# PSC Project

Project for the Principles for Software Composition course.

### Specifications
Write a google go program that takes a list of Boolean formulas over a set of 
propositional symbols and exploits go-routines and message passing communication 
to look for a truth assignment to propositional symbols that makes one of the 
formula true by exploring different alternatives in parallel.
